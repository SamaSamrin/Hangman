# Hangman

A non-visual hangmane game where the program picks a word from a list of 2500+ words with the Random package, and then the user gets to guess its letters correctly through a function we defined.
Unlike the traditional hangman game, we have not set a limited number of guesses here yet. 

TO DO:
- Read the words from a JSON file
- Visual progress through Turtle graphics
- Set the guess limit based on the visual moves
